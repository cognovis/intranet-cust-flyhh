    If a customer registration is cancelled by the project manager (so not automatically by the reminder system) and the
    status is at least pending payment (so we have a confirmation by the customer they want to participate) , create a
    correction invoice which contains refunds as in ::flyhh::record_after_confirmation_edit.â€
