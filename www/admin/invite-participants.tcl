we had such a blast with all of you last year that we want to make sure you get a spot in this yearâ€™s edition.<br />
You can therefore register already now before the official registration starts next Sunday the 17th of January at noon (12:00PM GMT+1).
</p>

We have plenty ideas for this year and we are already all excited about what is going to happen when we all meet again at the castle.</p>
Yours truly,<br />
